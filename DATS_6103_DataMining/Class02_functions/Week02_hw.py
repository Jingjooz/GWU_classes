# Our Goal: print out the 366 days in 2020
# 2020/1/1 
# 2020/1/2 and so forth

#if the month is of 30 days it will be present in the Month30 list hence this block will take control

#if cnt is 7 that means at 6 it was 'Sat' and now needs to go back to 'Sun '

# write a condition statement to determine the maxdays depending on the m value.
# For example, when m=0 (Jan), maxdays should be 31, m=3 (Apr), maxdays should be 30, etc.
# Try both ways, as a chunk of codes, or a one-liner

# Language python-3

# if f==1 that means year is leap and feb is of 29 days

#
# Change your m value (between 0 and 11, inclusive) and run the chunk to see if prints out the correct result.
#
# Challenge: if you can take into account that year is multiple of 4, EXCEPT when year is multiple of 100, the days 
# in Feb should be 29. Otherwise, there should be 28.  
# Examples: 2004, 2008, 2012, Feb has 29 days, but 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, ... 28 days. Year 2000 or any 
# century marks, multiples of 100, they are non-leap years, so only 28 days.
